9	The rpad f	The rpad function - rpad(str1, length [, str2]) returns different result compared to postgres, oracle and mysql when length is less than the lenght of str1.  For example:
10	another st	another string

14	If the dat	If the data does not conform to the schema, the loader will generate a null value or an error.
15	 For examp	 For example, in relation B, f1 is converted to integer because 5 is integer.
16	In relatio	In relation C, f1 and f2 are converted to double because we don't know the type of either f1 or f2.
17	If Pig can	If Pig cannot resolve incompatible types through implicit casts, an error will occur.
18	For exampl	For example, you cannot add chararray and float (see the Types Table for addition and subtraction).
19	A tuple is	A tuple is an ordered set of fields.
20	Use the ex	Use the exec command to run a Pig script with no interaction between the script and the Grunt shell (batch mode). Aliases defined in the script are not available to the shell; however, the files produced as the output of the script and stored on the system are visible after the script is run. Aliases defined via the shell are not available to the script.

23	With the e	With the exec command, store statements will not trigger execution; rather, the entire script is parsed before execution starts. Unlike the run command, exec does not change the command history or remembers the handles used inside the script. Exec without any parameters can be used in scripts to force execution up to the point in the script where the exec occurs.
