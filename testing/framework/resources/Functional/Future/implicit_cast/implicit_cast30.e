PostgreSQL has a rich set of native data types available to users. Users can add new types to PostgreSQL using the CREATE TYPE command.-999999999999999999

Use the exec command to run a Pig script with no interaction between the script and the Grunt shell (batch mode). Aliases defined in the script are not available to the shell; however, the files produced as the output of the script and stored on the system are visible after the script is run. Aliases defined via the shell are not available to the script.99999999999999999999999999999999999999

With the exec command, store statements will not trigger execution; rather, the entire script is parsed before execution starts. Unlike the run command, exec does not change the command history or remembers the handles used inside the script. Exec without any parameters can be used in scripts to force execution up to the point in the script where the exec occurs.-0.0000000000000000000000000000000000001
